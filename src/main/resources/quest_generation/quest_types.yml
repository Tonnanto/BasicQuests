# These are all available quest types.
# Everytime a new Quest is generated, the plugin uses this file to choose a new quest type.
# When the plugin has decided on a quest type, one of the available options for that quest type will be chosen next.
# Visit the quest types .yml file for further configuration.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A quest type with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# "advancements" is a list of vanilla advancements that are required before this option can be chosen.
# ENCHANT_ITEM quests, for example, can only be generated if the player has already completed the "story.mine_diamond" advancement.
