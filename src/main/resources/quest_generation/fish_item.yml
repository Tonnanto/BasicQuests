# These are all available items that can appear in fish item quests.
# Everytime a new fish item quest is generated, the plugin uses this file to choose a random item.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# An item with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.

default_min: 1   # the default minimum amount that can appear in a quest (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
default_max: 1   # the default maximum amount that can appear in a quest (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
default_step: 1  # the default step in which amounts increase (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
