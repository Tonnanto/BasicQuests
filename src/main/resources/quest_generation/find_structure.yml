# DISCLAIMER: Messing up the format (indentation, hyphens, etc.) can break the plugin.
# Delete this file to regenerate the default file on server reload.
# Read the README.md file first
#
# This file was generated for version 0.5.1
#
# These are all available structures that can appear in find structure quests.
# Everytime a new find structure quest is generated, the plugin uses this file to choose a random structure.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A structure with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# "advancements" is a list of vanilla advancements that are required before this option can be chosen.
# STRONGHOLD, for example, can only appear in find structure quests if the player has already completed the "nether.root" advancement.
# The advancement "story.root" prevents options from appearing in quests when a player joins the server for the very first time.
#
# "radius" is the distance the player needs to be from the structure's center to complete the quest.
# "radius" SHOULD NOT be changed!
#
# 1.18: In this version of spigot, only VILLAGES, OCEAN_RUINS, SHIPWRECKS and RUINED_PORTALS can be located. Other structures WILL NOT appear in quests.
