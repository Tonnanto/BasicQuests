# DISCLAIMER: Messing up the format (indentation, hyphens, etc..) can break the plugin.
# Read the README.md file first
#
# These are all available structures that can appear in find structure quests.
# Everytime a new find structure quest is generated the plugin uses this file to chose a random structure.
#
# weight is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A structure with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# advancements represents a list of vanilla advancements that are required before this option can be chosen.
# STRONGHOLD for example can only appear in find structure quests if the player has already completed the "nether.root" advancement.
# The advancement "story.root" prevents options from appearing in quests when a player joins the server for the very first time.
#
# radius is the distance the player needs to be from the structures center to complete the quest.
# radius SHOULD NOT be changed!
#
# 1.18: In this version of spigot only VILLAGES, OCEAN_RUINS, SHIPWRECKS and RUINED_PORTALS can be located. Other structures WILL NOT appear in quests.
