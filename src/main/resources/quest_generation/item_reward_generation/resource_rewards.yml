# This file was generated for version 0.5

# These are all available resource items that can appear in item rewards.
# Everytime a new item reward is generated the plugin considers these items along with items in the remaining item reward generation files.
#
# weight is the probability for an item to be chosen.
# An item with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# min, max and step determine the amount of the same item that can appear in a reward.
