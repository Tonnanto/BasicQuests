# This file was generated for version 0.5
#
# These are all available smithing templates that can appear in item rewards.
# Every time a new item reward is generated, the plugin considers these items along with items in the remaining item reward generation files.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# An item with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# Min, max and step determine the amount of the same item that can appear in a reward.
