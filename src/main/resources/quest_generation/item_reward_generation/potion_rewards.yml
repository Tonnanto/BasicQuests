# This file was generated for version 0.5.1
#
# These are all available potions that can appear in item rewards.
# Every time a new item reward is generated, the plugin considers these items along with items in the remaining item reward generation files.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A potion with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# Most potions have different variants. Each variant has a different value.
# BASE is the default potion
# EX is the extended variant (Indicated with a +). It Usually lasts 8 minutes instead of 3.
# UP is the stronger variant of a potion (Indicated with II)
#
# min, max and step determine the amount of the same potion that can appear in a reward.
#
# The questTypes list indicates which quest types have increased chance of containing this item in their rewards.
