# These are all available blocks that can appear in break block quests.
# Everytime a new break block quest is generated the plugin uses this file to chose a random block.
#
# weight is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A block with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# advancements represents a list of vanilla advancements that are required before this option can be chosen.
# GLOWSTONE for example can only appear in break block quests if the player has already completed the "story.mine_diamond" advancement.
