# These are all available blocks that can appear in break block quests.
# Everytime a new break block quest is generated, the plugin uses this file to choose a random block.
#
# "weight" is the probability for a block to be chosen.
# A block with weight 0.7 will appear seven times as often as one with weight 0.1.
#
# Have a look at the example in the README.md file to see how the final value of a quest is generated.
#
# "advancements" is a list of vanilla advancements that are required before this option can be chosen.
# GLOWSTONE, for example, can only appear in break block quests if the player has already completed the "story.mine_diamond" advancement.

default_min: 32     # the default minimum amount that can appear in a quest (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
default_max: 128    # the default maximum amount that can appear in a quest (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
default_step": 32   # the default step in which amounts increase (if not specified otherwise in chosen option)
