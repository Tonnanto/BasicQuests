# BasicQuests
A plugin for Spigot servers that implements randomly generated basic quests with rewards for players.


## General
Author: Tonnanto  
Current Version: 0.5

A **<ins>spigot</ins>** compatible Server is required to run this plugin!

Download the plugin and find the Project Page on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/basicquests.87972/) and [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/basicquests).


## How it works
Every player receives an initial amount of quests (default: 3).
You can view your active quests by using `/quests list` or `/quests list rewards`.
When a player completes a quest the reward can be received by clicking the reward button in the chat or by using `/quests reward`.
As soon as a quests reward has been collected the quest disappears from the list, and a newly generated quest will be added.  
By default, a player is allowed to skip one quest every 24h by using `/quests skip`.
Some quests require the player to complete an advancement before they can be generated. Quests in the nether for example require the player to have completed the ***"Diamonds!"*** advancement.  
Also, newly generated quests will increase in their quantities proportional to the players' playtime on the server: While a new player might receive a quest like ***"Mine 32 Iron Ore"*** a player with lots of playtime on the server would rather receive a quest like this ***"Mine 512 Iron Ore"***.
This feature can be precisely adjusted in the `config.yml` or be turned off entirely.  
Some quests are incredibly rare but promise very high rewards once completed. Each quest is assigned a number of stars (⭐) based on its difficulty. Collect stars by completing quests and compete with others on the leaderboard which can be viewed using `/quests leaderboard`.


## Quests
Quests are randomly generated in Basic Quests. 
Currently available quest types along with some examples are listed below:

* Mine Block
* Kill Entity
* Harvest Block
* Chop Wood
* Enchant Item
* Find Structure
* Trade with Villager
* Gain Level
* Reach Level
* Break Block
* **Fish Item (new)**
* **Increase Stat (new)**

Quest ideas I am thinking about implementing in the future:

* Breed Animal
* Tame Animal
* Smelt Item
* Brew Potion


## Rewards
Possible Rewards are either ***Items***, ***Money*** or ***XP***. You can enable or disable each of these reward types in the `config.yml`.
By default, only item-rewards are enabled. In order to use money-rewards you need to have an ***economy plugin*** connected via ***Vault***.
If multiple reward types are enabled one will be chosen at random when a new quest is generated - at least one reward type must be enabled or BasicQuests will not work.  
The value of a reward is proportional to the value of the quest and is multiplied by the `reward-factor` which can also be adjusted in the `config.yml`.
The value of a given quest is determined by a number of factors along its generation process.  
While money and xp-rewards are self-explanatory I'll list some examples for item-rewards below:

* Tools (Iron - Netherite) (Maybe enchanted)
* Armor (Chainmail - Netherite) (Maybe enchanted)
* Smithing Templates
* Enchanted Books
* Potions (Only positive effects - extended (+) and upgraded (II) variants)
* Food
* Resources (Most of the valuable things you can find underground - From Flint to Netherite)
* Rare Items (Enchanted Golden Apple, Music Disks, Saddle, ...)


## Quest Generation Customization
BasicQuest allows admins to fine tune the quest generation on their servers using a bunch of yaml files in the `quest_generation` directory.  
This allows for:
- adjusting or removing the probability of quest types
- adjusting or removing the probability specific quests within a quest type
- making certain quests more or less valuable. This will be reflected in the value of the reward.
- adjusting the amounts that appear in quests.

For further information about how to fine tune the generation process check out the readme file at `plugins/BasicQuests/quest_generation/README.md`


## Example Quests
You now know what type of Quests and Rewards are available.
Here are some examples of randomly generated Quests along with their Rewards.  
Remember that there are a lot of possibilities to tweak the Quest and Reward generation in the `config.yml` and in the `quest_generation` files.
